# What is the world setting?

From Jesús / Narrative team:

In B.M. 15 (Before Magic) the world lived and grew as any other, beginning with the rise of a species and the extinction of one…..Or so we thought, the story you’ve heard a million times over of a meteor destroying the dinosaurs putting forth a way of life for humans, but what if it didn’t. Gather around children for I have a story to tell of another time, another world where Dinosaurs and magic collided into a future never before thought to exist. Years ago a meteor did crash onto the earth, but not one of rock and fire, but rather one of a never before seen element, rather than cause global destruction, this meteor caused a shift in the balance of power and the future. For it was not a meteor to strike the earth, but a comet instead, one that would burrow into the earth and give birth to a new form of evolution, not through science but through Magic.

  

Leading to the Magical Dawn Era (A.M. After Magic) where Dinosaurs are not just overgrown lizards with sharp claws and teeth, but now possess the power of magic, along with humans and that constantly trying to learn it to level the playing field against this Magic dinos, leading to the DinoHuman War, only one species can rule the earth, only one may emerge victorious.
