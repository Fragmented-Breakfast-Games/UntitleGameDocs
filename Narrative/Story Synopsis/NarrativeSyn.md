# What is the world setting?

There hasn't been a solid decision here.
Proposed is a pre-historic era where the meteor that hits the earth doesn't kill life but instead granted the dinosaurs magical powers, with a physical
world setting being on the south-east coast line. (Think Georgia, South Carolina, Florida.)
