# AI-Generated Concept art

These images are *not for use* for the game. I do not condone the usage of AI art for official means (i.e., submissions of originality), however we are without a **Concept Lead**, and it would be nice to have a starting point to figure out the direction.

When we do eventually obtain an artist(s) capable of:

- Concept design
- Environment design
- Visual design

It would be good to bounce ideas off images such as these, as well as our current design lead (Mia), and get the ball rolling with animation and rigging.


## Sidenote:

I am on the DALLE-2 waitlist, so if and when I'm accepted, I'll have a more *tailored* set of concept art, but again it's AI art.
