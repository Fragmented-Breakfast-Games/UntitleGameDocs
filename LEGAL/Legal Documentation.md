## First of all

What we are in the beginning stages of developing is an IP(intellectual property), which has a *lot* of working bits and pieces. One could say the legal process of a company is much harder to navigate than code itself.

> IP is an abbreviation that actually stands for a surprising amount of things (talk about two letters being really popular). In the world of video games, though, IP often stands for Intellectual Property, and you’ll often only hear it when a developer or publisher is talking about a brand new original game. It’s basically just a legal way of saying here’s a game that we made that nobody else can make, because we made it first.

>The term is used because it protects artistic works such as books, literature, inventions, designs, symbols, and games. Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) protect IPs from being stolen. It’s why copycats often have to go to court, and why every single platform doesn’t have a Super Mario game.

Essentially the idea is for protection. Before we can claim Intellectual Property, we need to be sure that what we are creating is not already infringing on another developer's IP. (I believe we're doing a great job of that already, but if need be; revisions will have to be made.)

## Second and (Very Important) 
*The Company*

via Mia:

>Big talk. Legal shit (liability, taxes, etc.) before game hits the market we need to create an LLC (protects us as individuals from being sued) Revenue goes to LLC and is taxed.
>
>Then the revenue is distributed to us and it is listed as additional income on the 1040 tax form. I spent some extra time after class asking the professor questions. 
>
>Even if we make it a free game we need the LLC (limited liability company) for legal safety net

### Limited Liability Protection

> Video game companies will benefit from liability protection because of the risk of expensive lawsuits related to copyright and trademark infringement claims. There are also general business risks, such as financial data breaches and even workplace accidents.

For instance, if we inserted an easter egg relating to Destiny in some way in our game, and Bungie's legal team did not take too kindly to it; our personal assets are protected in the event of commercial brankruptcy or loan default. **However - if we did not maintain a corporate veil, this is null and void.** <a href="https://howtostartanllc.com/maintain-llc-corporate-veil">[info on corporate void]</a>

LLCs are *very* easy and cheap to form, and there is additional information regarding that <a href="https://howtostartanllc.com/should-i-start-an-llc/video-game-company">here</a>.

## In the meantime

It may / may not be useful to use a license agreement in any code we share until another sollution comes forth:

Alternatively, we can opt to simply have no license.

I would suggest some form of license or notification of personal property, but these are the options laid before us at the moment; and we have plenty of time.
