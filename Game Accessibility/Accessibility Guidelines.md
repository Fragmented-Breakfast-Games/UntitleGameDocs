# Accessibility

As promised, here is a write up for guidelines I would like to implement into future development of the game.

Game accessibility is important to me as well as many others. While my epilepsy is does not tend to react to flashing images and the such (i.e., photosensitive), I still have a hard time viewing this imagery. Those predisposed to migraines or other neurological conditions may have the same reaction, and become nauseated, have a seizure, or a migraine. These are just a few examples in terms of issues I would like to prevent/alleviate, but there is so much more.

That being said, not every guideline will apply to our game, nor may it be easy to pull of; however I feel it's important to at least work on it so to benefit the most people. The sooner these types of features are implemented in not just our game, but all games - the better off all gamers will be.

I will be directly referencing this <a href="https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/">website</a> as well as posts from users on twitter.

# Motor
(Control/Mobility)

- While I believe we intend to have the option for WASD & ←↑↓→ (arrow keys) for movement, allowing remapping/reconfiguration would be <a href="https://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/allow-controls-to-be-remapped-reconfigured/">imperative</a>.
- We should ensure that the UI(User Interface) can be accessed by using the same input method as gameplay. Given that this is primarily a Keyboard mashy game, allowing the player to simply tab between UI options and press the 'Enter' key would work great.
- Allowance for the mouse is okay too. We shouldn't restrict it to KB only - additionally adjusting the sensitivity of the mouse for player would be important
- Simple controls. Theres no need to overcomplicate things. More complex control / configurations require a higher degree of motar skill, as well as having to remember the complex combinations. 
- Any interactive element / virtual control needs to be large and well spaced.


# Vision
- Colors are a useful means of communicating well established meanings, but for those who cannot distinguish/perceive differences, the meaning is lost and this affects them; *No essential information should be conveyed by a fixed color alone.*
	- Additionally there is conditions such as tritanopia, cataracts, achromatopsia. 
	- Wherever possible, we should use color as a back up for communitication info, such as text or a symbol, pattern, or shape.
	- Lastly, regarding UI elements - allowing the player free choice of a setting for the palette is always an option, and perhaps a beneficial one. This could look something like:
		- Deueranopia
		- Protanopia
		- Tritanopia
		- Custom
		- Default
- Any UI elements / Dialogue elements must be easily readable with a default font size.
	- Amazon's Guideline is a 28px minimum when viewed on a 1080p screen. That said:
	> When viewed on an average size screen this tallies for what would be expected for someone with 20/20 vision while using the Snellen Chart. However because it does not take any degree of vision impairment into account, use 28px as a minimum rather than a target, aim to exceed it wherever possible.
	
	- For dialogue, it would be reasonable to have an additional option to zoom in on speech bubbles (assuming we use speech bubbles.) If the text appears on the bottom of the screen like subtitles, allowing the user to adjust size is useful.
		- Additionally, having VA reading the dialogue would be incredibly useful. This would offer two forms of accessiblity for the player.
- High contrast between text / UI, and background.
	- the <a href="https://snook.ca/technical/colour_contrast/colour.html#fg=33FF33,bg=333333">snook contrast checker</a> is great tool for this

- UI elements should of course be large and well spaced.

# Hearing
- Subtitles was already mentioned, and this is already a given
- Separate volume controls / mutes for effects, speech, background, and music is absolutely important.
- No essential information should be conveyed via sound alone.
- Any dialogue, subtitles, etc., should be presented in a clear and easily read/understood fashion.

# General Guidelines

- Wide choice of difficulty levels.
	- I believe we all want to make this a fantastic game, and we want something cool to come out of it. That said - allowing it to be flexible and as open to as many people as possible should be our first step; both the most competitive gamers, and those who need a little help.
		- We should absolutely mocking players, even in jest, for choosing the easier options, while offering praise to those that choose the hardest option. Yes - there are games that do this, both sets of players should have the same experience while feeling rewarded in some way.
- Details for accessibility should be included not only in-game, but on any details we put out regarding the game. (Patch notes, state of the game, roadmap, how-to, online instruction manual / instructional videos)
- All settings should be saved / remembered.

# Feedback
Getting feedback on the game itself during Alpha / Beta testing is important, yes. Whats moreso is receiving feedback based on whatever accessibility features we implement. Including those with disabilities in playtesting and user reasearch is absolutely important and would provide the most effective way of getting precise and detailed observations.
